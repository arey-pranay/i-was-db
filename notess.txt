the head.jsx acts like the head tag of your html files. It has the meta data, and you use this for SEO otimization and stuffs
the layout.jsx has the part tht is not supposed to go away in any case. So it is always there.
the page.jsx contains the actual content that you want to create
aliases are used to conveniently and simply import from different directories
using react-icons to make the icons from the https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/ website

Link tag: go to the URL without refreshing the page

using the next-themes for the dark mode, but useContext can only be used with client side but to not make the entire layout client side, we can wrap it in another comonent
So we will wrap all the layout.jsx contents into Provider Component, and then in that Provider component, we will use the theme pckeg's ThemeProvider.
